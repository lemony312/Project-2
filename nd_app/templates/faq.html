                  We cover a wide range of popular eateries from casual sandwich joints to fine dining restaurants in Manhattan. They are all rated over 3.5 on yelp.

               No. We are offering this service to you completely free of charge. All you have to do is love eating out!

                      <strong>I am seeing different perks from my friends. Why?</strong>
                    </p>

                     <p id ="" >
               Eateries sometimes have target customer types, and we control who sees the perks in that case. Generally speaking, you can unlock more perks by redeeming more perks, showing up on time for your reservations, and being a nice customer!

                   We are very sorry that this is happening. Sometimes the eateries have new employees who have not been informed about our service. Please ask to speak to a manager in this case and show your screen of DinersCode with the perks. If the problem persists, please email 
                   <a href="mailto:feedback@dinerscode.com" style="color:#F9DC8C;">feedback@dinerscode.com</a>. We will respond immediately.

                   We strongly encourage informing the eateries right away. The perks we offer are privileges for diners who are bona-fide participants of our dinersâ€™ community.  No-shows can damage your reputation and decrease the perks you will be able to see in the future.
